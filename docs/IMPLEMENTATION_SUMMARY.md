# PHASH Similar Images Search - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive PHASH-based similar images search feature for the media_scoring application. This feature allows users to find visually similar images using perceptual hashing (PHASH) with full integration into the existing filter system.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### API Endpoints (4 new endpoints)
1. **POST /api/search/similar/by-path**
   - Search for similar images by providing a user path
   - Converts user_path to file_path using user_path_prefix
   - Returns search image info and top N similar results

2. **POST /api/search/similar/by-upload**
   - Search by uploading an image file
   - Computes PHASH on-the-fly for uploaded image
   - Temporary file handling with automatic cleanup
   - Returns similar images from database

3. **POST /api/search/similar/by-phash**
   - Search directly using a PHASH value
   - Used internally for uploaded image searches
   - Bypasses file lookup for efficiency

4. **GET /api/search/file-info-by-path**
   - Retrieve file metadata by user path
   - Returns filename, path, PHASH, file type, and extension
   - Used for validating search images

#### Database Enhancements
- Enhanced `DatabaseService.find_similar_files_by_hash()` to accept filter parameters:
  - `file_types`: Filter by file extensions
  - `min_score` / `max_score`: Filter by rating
  - `start_date` / `end_date`: Filter by creation date
  - `nsfw_filter`: Filter by NSFW status
- Returns tuples of (MediaFile, distance) for accurate similarity ranking
- Fixed NSFW filter logic to use AND for SFW (both flags must be False/None)
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing support

#### Security Fixes
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Replaced LIKE queries with exact match and endswith
- **Input Validation**: Proper sanitization of user-provided paths
- **File Upload Safety**: Secure temporary file handling with cleanup

### Frontend Components

#### UI Elements
1. **Similar Images Pill**
   - Added to search toolbar after NSFW pill
   - Shows "Off" when inactive, "Top N" when active
   - Visual indicator (pill-modified class) when active

2. **Pill Editor**
   - User path input field with submit button (▶)
   - "Upload Search Image" button for file selection
   - Thumbnail preview of search image (200x200px max)
   - PHASH value display
   - Max results slider (1-50, default: 10)
   - Max distance slider (1-32, default: 10)
   - Standard Apply/Clear/Close buttons

#### JavaScript Functions
- `loadSearchImageByPath(userPath)`: Fetch file info by user path
- `uploadSearchImage(file)`: Upload and compute PHASH for image
- `displaySearchImageInfo(imagePath, phash)`: Show thumbnail and PHASH
- `applySimilarImagesSearch()`: Execute search with current filters
- Integration with `applyDatabaseFilters()` for filter coordination

#### Styling
- Comprehensive CSS for all three themes:
  - style_default.css
  - style_darkcandy.css
  - style_pastelcore.css
- Mobile-responsive design with touch-friendly controls
- Thumbnail preview with proper aspect ratio
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

### Configuration

#### Required Dependencies
- `python-multipart`: Added to requirements.txt for file upload support
- `imagehash`: Already present, used for PHASH computation
- `pillow`: Already present, used for image processing

#### Settings
```yaml
enable_database: true  # Required for feature to work
user_path_prefix: "/mnt/qnap-sd/SecretFolder"  # For path conversion
```

### Testing

#### Test Coverage
1. **PHASH Computation Tests** (`tests/test_similar_search.py`)
   - Verifies PHASH computation for images
   - Tests hash distance calculation
   - Validates identical images produce identical hashes
   - Proper cleanup in finally blocks

2. **Application Startup**
   - Successfully starts with all new endpoints
   - No import or syntax errors
   - All routes registered correctly

3. **Manual Testing Checklist** (requires database setup)
   - [ ] Click Similar Images pill
   - [ ] Enter user path and search
   - [ ] Upload image and search
   - [ ] Verify thumbnail display
   - [ ] Adjust max results slider
   - [ ] Adjust max distance slider
   - [ ] Verify filter integration
   - [ ] Check results sorting by distance

### Code Quality

#### Code Review Results
- ✅ All SQL injection vulnerabilities fixed
- ✅ Proper upload workflow implementation
- ✅ Correct thumbnail URL handling
- ✅ Resource cleanup in finally blocks
- ✅ NSFW filter logic corrected
- ✅ No remaining security or functionality issues

#### Best Practices
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Proper logging for debugging
- Consistent code style with existing codebase
- Clear documentation and comments
- Type hints for API models

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Database must be enabled for feature to work
2. Only images with PHASH in database can be found
3. Videos use only first frame for similarity
4. Upload creates temporary files (though cleaned up immediately)

### Potential Improvements
1. Batch PHASH computation for new files
2. Alternative hash algorithms (pHash, dHash, wHash)
3. Auto-adjustment of similarity threshold
4. Result caching for repeated searches
5. Multi-frame video analysis
6. ML-based similarity scoring
7. Cluster similar images into groups
8. Duplicate image detection
9. Progressive search (start with strict, gradually loosen)
10. PHASH computation progress indicator

## Usage Examples

### Search by User Path
```javascript
// User pastes: /mnt/qnap-sd/SecretFolder/images/photo.png
// System converts to: images/photo.png
// Finds in database and retrieves PHASH
// Searches for top 10 similar images within distance 10
```

### Search by Upload
```javascript
// User uploads: local_image.jpg
// System computes PHASH: "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8"
// Searches database for similar images
// Returns results sorted by distance
```

### API Integration
```bash
# Search by path
curl -X POST http://localhost:7862/api/search/similar/by-path \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_path": "/mnt/qnap-sd/SecretFolder/images/photo.png",
    "max_results": 10,
    "max_distance": 10,
    "file_types": ["jpg", "png"],
    "min_score": 3
  }'

# Search by upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:7862/api/search/similar/by-upload \
  -F "file=@image.jpg" \
  -F "max_results=10" \
  -F "max_distance=10"
```

## Conclusion
